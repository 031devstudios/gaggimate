## Features

- **Temperature Control**: Monitor the boiler temperature to ensure optimal brewing conditions.
- **Pump Control**: Start and stop the pump with the press of a button.
- **Safety Features**: Automatic shutoff if the system becomes unresponsive or overheats.
- **User Interface**: Simple, intuitive display to control and monitor the machine.

## Hardware

- **Gaggia Espresso Machine**
- **ESP32-S3 Display**: Runs the user interface and communicates with the system.
- **ESP-WROOM32 DevKit**: Handles the machineâ€™s low-level control.
- **K-Type Thermocouple with MAX6675**: Reads the temperature of the boiler.
- **AC SSR and Mosfet Board**: Controls the heating element (boiler).
- **5V Relay**: Controls the pump.

## How It Works

The display allows you to control the espresso machine and see live temperature updates. If the machine becomes unresponsive or the temperature goes too high, it will automatically turn off for safety.

## Installation

1. Connect the ESP32-S3 Display, ESP-WROOM32 DevKit, and other components to the Gaggia.
2. Upload the firmware to both microcontrollers.
3. Enjoy your smarter coffee-making experience!
